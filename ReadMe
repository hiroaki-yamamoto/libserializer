What this document?
This document describes how to build SimpleSerializer and its document.

Dependencies:
Before building, you must install the following on your PC:
*)cmake
*)doxygen
*)GCC including g++ and OpenMP.

Probably, you can get them by using a package manager on your Linux/Unix System.
If you are using Windows, you can use MinGW or MinGW-w64. However, I can't support windows cases.

How to build:
1) Open your favorite terminal and cd into the source directory of this library.
2) Make a directory named "build" and cd into it.
3) Type "cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..". You can use the following option:

    WITHOUT_UNIX_MODE
        If this option is set to true, the building process is go on Non-Unix mode. By default, it is false.
        The difference is only time stump on testing: Unix mode gets micro-seconds, Non-Unix mode uses time(NULL).
    BUILD_TEST
        If this option is set to true, the building process builds a test executable file. By default, it is false.
        If you set this option to true, the building takes time.
    GENERATE_DOC
        If this option is set to true, the building process generates the document of this library. By default, it is true if doxygen is found, false otherwise.
    STATIC
        This option is only used for building test. If this option is set to true, the test executable is build statically. By default, it is false.
        
You can use other CMake option.

4) Type "make" the process will be done automatically. Of course, you can use parallelized make. i.e. make -jN
5) Type "make DESTDIR=to_install install". to_install is a directory to install SimpleSerializer.

That's all done.
